# WebWake Droid

**WebWake Droid** is a comprehensive Android application designed to wake up Windows computers over a local network (Wake-on-LAN). It features a powerful, built-in web server that provides a user-friendly interface for managing devices and settings, complete with a robust authentication system.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Embedded Web Server**: Runs a Ktor-based web server on your Android device, accessible on your local network (default port 8080).
- **Wake-on-LAN (WOL)**: Easily wake up registered devices by sending a "magic packet" through the web interface.
- **Robust Authentication**:
    - Secure login system with password hashing (BCrypt).
    - All features are protected and require login.
- **Dynamic Web Interface**:
    - Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive UI.
    - **Dashboard**: View all registered devices, initiate WOL, and enter edit mode to edit or delete devices.
    - **Settings Page**: A central hub for all configurations.
- **Comprehensive Settings Management**:
    - **User Management**: Change your username and password.
    - **Device Management**: Add, edit, or delete MAC addresses for WOL.
    - **Port Configuration**: Change the default HTTP service port.
    - **Public Network Access**:
        - **Cloudflare Tunnel**: Expose your service with a Cloudflare Tunnel token.
        - **Ngrok**: Use Ngrok for public access by providing an auth token and optional custom domain.
    - **SSL/TLS Support**: Secure your web server with HTTPS by providing your own SSL certificate and private key.
- **Self-Contained**: All required dependencies, including `cloudflared` and `ngrok`, are packaged within the application.
